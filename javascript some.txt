ðŸ§  Why are digits turning to zeros after a point?

JavaScriptâ€™s Number type is based on IEEE-754 double-precision floating-point, which means:

    It can safely represent integers only up to 15â€“16 digits (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER = 9007199254740991).

Once you go beyond 15-16 digits, precision is lost and the browser silently rounds or pads with zeros â€” hence your big number turning into things like:

321,321,313,812,931,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00

âœ… Solution

1. Limit input to max 15 digits You can enforce this manually or with Yup validation. Iâ€™ll show both.
