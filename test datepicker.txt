 DatePicker.test.jsx â€” Test Summary & Purpose
ðŸ”§ Goal:

To test the behavior of the custom <DatePicker /> component based on the requirements:

    It shows the correct date
    Allows only future dates
    Responds to clicks and keyboard arrows

âœ… Test Breakdown:
1. "renders the initial month and year"

    Purpose: Make sure the component displays the reachDate passed in props.
    We use dayjs() to get todayâ€™s month/year.
    expect(screen.getByText(...)) checks that the formatted date is rendered.

2. "increments month on right arrow button click"

    Simulates a user clicking the > button.
    Expects the component to update to the next month.
    Also checks that the onDateChange callback was triggered.

3. "does not decrement before current month"

    Simulates a user clicking the < button while already on the current month.
    Makes sure:
        The component does not go into the past
        onDateChange is not called

4. "responds to keyboard arrow keys"

    Focuses on the date picker div (with tabIndex=0)
    Simulates an ArrowRight key press.
    Verifies:
        Month increases
        onDateChange is called (just like a click)

ðŸ§  Technologies used:

    @testing-library/react: For rendering and interacting with the DOM
    jest.fn(): For spying on callback props like onDateChange
    dayjs: Used to match actual formatting logic used in the component
