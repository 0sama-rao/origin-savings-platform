✅ Why Use React + Vite Instead of CRA?
1. 🚀 Speed (Vite is FAST!)

    Vite uses native ES modules and only bundles code on-demand.
    It starts almost instantly and updates lightning-fast during development.
    CRA can be slow to start and slower on rebuilds (uses Webpack behind the scenes).

2. 🔧 Better Developer Experience

    Vite has simpler config (based on modern ESM).
    HMR (Hot Module Reloading) is faster and more reliable than CRA.
    Easy integration with TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, Prettier, etc.

3. 📦 Modern Stack Support

    Works seamlessly with PostCSS, Tailwind, and modern JS features.
    Out-of-the-box support for ES6 modules, dynamic imports, etc.
    Easier to extend with plugins (compared to ejecting CRA).

4. ⚙️ Lightweight & Minimal

    Vite doesn’t include bloat or hidden Webpack configs.
    You can see and control everything in vite.config.js.

5. 🧪 Testing Compatibility

    Works well with Vitest (Vite-native testing) or Jest (with minimal setup).
    Faster testing dev cycle compared to CRA.

✅ Why you picked Vite = ✅ Modern + Fast + Clean

It’s the better dev choice today unless you're working on a legacy project that requires CRA.
